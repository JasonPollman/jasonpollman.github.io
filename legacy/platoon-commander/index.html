        <h2 class="thesis">"A platoon commander who makes battlefield decisions in order to destroy enemy targets."</h2>
        <p>There have been many variants of the "Tower Defense" style game&mdash;a single player strategy game in which the user 'constructs' towers to prevent AI units from moving along predefined paths towards the user's base.<br /><br />Platoon Commander takes this popular game concept and reverses the human and computer roles for an interesting spin on an original idea. Traditionally, in the Tower Defense style game, it's been the task of the user to prevent the AI from moving units towards some predefined target&mdash;however, in Platoon Commander, it's the AI who has to stop the user from moving units towards its base.

        <p>
            Build your squads by adding units of varying abilities to each squad. Move your units towards the target objective by deploying them down "war" paths&mdash;but watch out for enemy towers! As you unlock new levels, you'll unlock new, more powerful units... but of course, with success comes new responsibility, and your missions will get harder.
